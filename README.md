"I will use the Scrum framework because it provides a clear,
 structured approach to managing work through short,
 time-boxed sprints. It promotes transparency, 
collaboration, and continuous improvement through regular ceremonies like daily stand-ups,
 sprint reviews, and retrospectives. Scrum also helps prioritize work based on business value,
 ensuring that the team delivers incremental results that can be reviewed and adapted based on feedback. This makes it ideal for managing projects that require flexibility and regular delivery of functional outputs."
